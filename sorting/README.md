# Sorting: Bubble Sort
This task is a simple bubble sort realization to sort an array.

## Input Format:  
The first line contains an integer, _n_, the size of the array _a_.  
The second line contains n space-separated integers _a[i]_.  

## Output Format:  
Number of swaps to sort the array.  
First element of the sorted array.  
Last element of the sorted array.  

# Mark and Toys
In this task I realized search of the maximum number of elements in the array whose sum is less than set number _k_ using merge sort.  

## Input Format:
The first line contains two integers, _n_ - number of elements in the array _a_, and _k_.  
The second line contains n space-separated integers _a[i]_.

## Output Format:
An integer that denotes the maximum number of elements whose sum is less than _k_.  

# Fraudulent Activity Notifications
This task is the relization of binary search algorithm.  

# Sorting: Comparator

In this task I realized simple custom comparator to sort elements in the list.
